	<p>
		The solutions could be graded with the default checker (their output 
		should match with tes output) or you could provide a custom one. This
		could be useful when there's more than one solution. You should upload
		a staticly compiled binary(with -static) which takes as parameters 3 
		files - the input file, the corect output and the contestant's 
		output. On the first line it should print 1.0 if the contestant's 
		output is correct and 0.0 otherwise. For more info you can reference
		<a href="https://cms.readthedocs.org/en/v1.2/Task%20types.html#batch">
			CMS's graders</a>, whose format we use here.
